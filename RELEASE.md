# Release Guide

This document describes the release procedures for package maintainers.

**Package Distribution:** This package is published to [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/promidas-utils) (`promidas-utils`).

Releases are automatically published when a GitHub Release is created.

**Audience:** This document is for package maintainers only. Contributors should refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for PR guidelines.

## Release Procedures

### 1. Pre-Release Checklist

Execute all of the following checks before releasing:

#### a. Run All Tests

```bash
# Standard tests
npm test

# Tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

Ensure all tests pass.

#### b. Validate Subpath Exports

```bash
npm run test:exports
```

Ensure there are no export validation errors. See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md#subpath-exports-validation) for details.

#### c. Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Linter
npm run lint

# Formatting
npm run format:check

# Type checking
npm run typecheck
```

Ensure all checks pass.

#### d. Verify Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Ensure there are no build errors.

### 2. Version Update

Update the version following Semantic Versioning:

- **MAJOR** (x.0.0): Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (0.x.0): New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH** (0.0.x): Bug fixes

**Choose one of the following methods:**

#### Method A: Using npm version (Recommended)

```bash
# Update version
npm version patch --no-git-tag-version  # or minor, major

# Regenerate lib/version.ts from the new version, then run tests
npm run build
npm test
```

Proceed to Step 3.

#### Method B: Manual update

Manually edit `package.json`:

```json
{
    "version": "0.6.0" // Example: 0.5.0 → 0.6.0
}
```

Then update `package-lock.json`:

```bash
npm install
```

Proceed to Step 3.

### 3. Update CHANGELOG.md

Document the changes in `CHANGELOG.md`:

### 4. Commit and Create Tag

```bash
# Commit changes (include the regenerated lib/version.ts)
git add package.json package-lock.json CHANGELOG.md lib/version.ts
git commit -m "chore(release): x.y.z"

# Create tag (signed, using .npmrc configuration)
git tag -a vx.y.z -m "Release vx.y.z"

# Push commits and tags
git push origin main
git push origin vx.y.z
```

### 5. Create GitHub Release

1. Navigate to the repository's Releases page
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Select tag: `vx.y.z`
4. Enter release title: `vx.y.z`
5. Copy the relevant version content from CHANGELOG.md
6. Click "Publish release"

**Automated Publishing:** When the release is published, the [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/publish-package-to-npmjs.yml) automatically:

1. Builds the package (`npm run build`)
2. Publishes to npmjs.com (`npm publish`)

No manual `npm publish` is required.

> Trusted Publishing requires npm 11.5.1 or later, which the workflow provisions.
> The legacy `publish-package-to-github-packages.yml` workflow is disabled.

## Troubleshooting

### Release Workflow Failed

If the GitHub Actions workflow fails:

1. Check the workflow run logs in the "Actions" tab
2. Verify `package.json` version matches the release tag
3. Ensure all CI checks passed before creating the release
4. Verify the Trusted Publishing configuration on npmjs (the package's trusted publisher must reference this repository and the `publish-package-to-npmjs.yml` workflow)

### Tag Already Exists

If you need to recreate a tag:

```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d vx.y.z

# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/vx.y.z

# Create new tag
git tag -a vx.y.z -m "Release vx.y.z"
git push origin vx.y.z
```
